# ParseStarter
This is the starter code for the com.lexer.Lexer-Parser project. This code just reads in text, including multiple lines, from
a file into a String. There are also constants defined for the various com.lexer.Token types. You'll need to code the com.lexer.Lexer, and 
create the com.lexer.Token and Parser classes from scratch
